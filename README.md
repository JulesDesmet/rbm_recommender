# Recommender Systems using Restricted Boltzmann Machines

## Project requirements

- *Python 3.9* is required, older versions don't work without a couple of modifications.
- The libraries used are listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). These can be installed by running the notebook, or by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
- The *Goodreads* datasets (i.e. the books, interactions, and reviews datasets) should be present in the [data](./data) directory. The gzipped archives should not be decompressed, this is handled by the code.
- The main notebook (currently) is [main.ipynb](main.ipynb).
